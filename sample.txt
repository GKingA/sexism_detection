@sexyhaileyx Loves the short skirt very attractive xx
@Orangezipple1 @pvtjokerus Look at the way she looks at him, like every movie you've ever seen in which a prostitute is pretending to agree with him but secretly is about to do something dastardly.
I can’t seem to find any success on Twitch :/ It can’t possibly be because my content is boring, it must be all these women streamers taking all my viewers with their big mommy milkers!!!!
ladies! whats something that’s not necessary sexist but f e e l s sexist? for me it’s when boys call girls a bitch especially in an aggressive way
@JaniceDean @alexplitsas What do you say, @Alyssa_Milano ?  #metooDo you still advocate for believing ALL women? Or are you gonna pass on this one like you did Tara Reade....
TRLL ME TELL ME WHO YOU LIVE THE MOST TELL ME GIRL I REALLY WANNA KNOW
If I wanted THOUSANDS of followers all I had to do was make gifs, cross stitches or pencil sketches of famous actors that middle aged women want to fuck and make 99% of my posts about drooling over them.Or get my tits out. I know how this game works, and I'm refusing to play.
@Sweetzerlandia @MonsieurCellop1 @secularagnostic @GregAbbott_TX Yes it makes me mad and sometimes it's hard not to laugh but at the end of the day his "followers" are our family or friends, or at least our countrymen/women. I hate to see anyone be fooled by such a psycho. He will ruin anyone's life without a second thought.
@ChrisExcel102 Kodwa i dont think yall will ever know the damage yall do to a woman when yall cheat. You can love her till the sky falls but cheating does so much damage hence we have women called evil  bitter witches today.
@JayysonWolfe youre right, whores get paid, i meant slut
#2000StimulusCheck all I am going to say, Pelosi and Schumer didn't take out a single ridiculous pork stuffer. No one will blame Trump for again threatening Veto. American tax dollars go to Americans, not Pelosi and Schumer's whims!
@littlered_xox U look stunning and your tits and cleavage looks incredible
@GoogleWalkout My gut says they will replace Dr. Gebru with a CIA plant. Gotta root out those ethical behaviors by AI. AI has to be as discriminatory as police, legislators &amp; Facial Recognition. After the multi-million $ contracts announced between CIA &amp; tech giants we should not be surprised..
@kyleisinnocent @stone_toss You don't need to be consistent or even make sense. You pick a word out of the ideological word box, and throw it at people who threaten your frigid ideology.
and the thing that makes sexual assault is not the specific act being carried out, but rather the lack of consent to that act, WHATEVER it happens to be, kink or vanilla or fucking street harassment
@idew2 @MsButterflyyy In a tweet about systemic racism you pulled a #NotAllWhitePeople. If it doesn't apply to you, it's not meant for you. What if you were talking about your bad experiences with men/patriarchy &amp; some guy came in &amp; pulled a #NotAllMen on you?
@DMiketon @PhineasTGage well when i said it you were so offended u felt the need to quote tweet me and call me sexist
@tropotropotropo @PapaGraub_exe And remember how all those anti #GAMERGATE supporters and male feminist allies all turned out to be sexual predators, rapists, and pedophiles. https://t.co/kvB1jsGdlQ
Aye bro if you had a gold digger just say that  https://t.co/vi1jVhdkJi
i wish i had no fucking tits
@ejeancarroll @realDonaldTrump @JoshuaMatz8 As an American, and particularly as a woman, I’m watching closely as your win will be vindication for many women that have been abused, then humiliated by “justice.” It’s time for accountability on so many levels.  Can you imagine if “grab ‘em by the pussy” applied to Ivanka?
@marywinfrey @DanaSmithTN04 @katebame1 @KevinMKruse Actually of all the things it is, I don’t think political is one of them. She’s self destructive and mentally unwell and following a pattern of some women since the beginning of time. I do think we can blame the patriarchy if we like.
FP:
@juicyboobs2 I would kiss and bite both cheeks before parting your gorgeous pussy lips with my tongue then run it up over your pussy to your tight little ass then tease your clit with my cock before slipping it in your tight pussy until you cover it in cum
Daddy just loves to spank young women on the bare ass https://t.co/IRsLzxzDdU
@just_charless @_broken_god_ Our conversation on traditional masculinity, and feminism are different.....people were against female education,women being empowered, women being seen as equal to men in societal standing....and it just so happened that it was mostly men because men reaped more from it
FN:
you see that toxic masculinity doesn't even bother me but that "mansplaining" is absolute rubbish; a lot of stupid and unnecessary words have been coined these days https://t.co/zEDHyxbk06
the definition of cock tease is me driving past the exit for my house bc i have to clock out of work first
A man that can drive is sooooo attractive cause I know for a fact I can’t do this shit  https://t.co/Zv7UDWFuuo
bad bitches is the only thing that i like
@itzitunos SCREAMINGYou earlier: eh shouldn't drink maybe Cey: great choice boo!!! Me: drink you fucking filthy slutbag
I want to get gangbanged. It’s been so long since my last one. Anyone want to set one up? https://t.co/Ja1RbdNKDv
#QatarAirways should've prioritized fixing the problem, not building up its image. Women were #harassed at its premises and they take a month long to respond to the incident?! This is just unfair! #DoSomething https://t.co/lyVBvWT3Ig
@UnicornHairz I mean either A: They are actually sexist and are beyond help so they don't deserve your attention/time or B: they are just trying to get a reaction/piss you off so giving them that will just give them exactly what they want. Ppl can call me w.e the want from behind a mute lol
i'm leaving twitter. I've made my feelings clear about the fat useless cunt and his sycophants. I hope they all rot in hell. Their parents should be ashamed of themselves for such crap parenting that made him and them the way they are - no moral values whatsoever, Fuck them all
My hairdresser was braiding my hair until about 10pm. While appreciating her, I suggested she showers &amp; sleep once she gets home. Next thing she apprehensively admits that she has to still cook. Me: cook for? Your husband can't prepare something for him &amp; the kids  https://t.co/APbc4Bf9qS
@Neha12063439 @manish_sindwani @jaidutt1 @TejinderjitK @Azure16041350 @ambar_hitman @StringReveals @AnubhavMohanty_ @roopenshu @CriticsUnbiased @PriyaScifi when their youth is gone. But certainly it's a big plus to men (not simps) who fight against feminism and whole MRA movement. I expect these women to.. show the world they are not oppressed and happiest compared to feminists, show men that good women still exist and support them
yes i'm sure you tweeting about how much you hate trans people on twitter is materially helping women
It’s literally been less than 24 hours and a woman who did it first has been erased from the story #vaccine #everydaysexism https://t.co/HhoEWv5VkS
@ZoryaStar @Freezurn This also goes into a broader issue is society fetishing youth especially when it comes to women, and you can call me an sjw or whatever but there’s this deeply sexist mindset that women just stop being attractive at like 30, and it’s why you see a lot of famous guys with very
i like that three of these four weren't quite insane enough for fox news to keep(though, i guess it was more the sexual harassment lawsuits and payouts that got O'Reilly in the end) https://t.co/bDcmpvXBYh
@AshokShrivasta6 @KanganaTeam WOW people are actually scared of a single woman भारतीय नारी सब पर भारी and these traitors should be scared of her. Remember one thing you can stop one Kangna but uncountable Kangna will counter back and stand for what is right
Women got the worst RTs ever so if you a woman i most likely got yours turned off
it’s literally impossible for me to not be a slutbag online
@NotMorganHanson @HumanMagpie @ForwomenScot Just read High Court judgement. Forget personal attacks, feminism, transphobia. The judges made clear conclusions-lack of evidence for use of PBs in avoiding puberty altogether, and is experimental. Read Tavi’s own research-showed PB restricted growth but CONCEALED until forced..
I find it astonishing that in 2021 women are not only denied a basic human right to name their own biological sex but nor can they lay claim to identify themselves by their achievements (ref Dr @DrBiden ) for fear of getting above themselves. All naysayers being male of course.
@El86562179 No. I wouldn't send him down the road for a box of matches. He'd probably come back drunk, towing along some bird with a very short skirt and back-combed hair.
@Grantarita I can see why people would be mad at you when you look like a prostitute from the neck down and the thrice-divored alcoholic trucker who buys her services from the neck up, you brown fruit.
TN:
@rion89 @AOC Oh! Okay! The “minority” you speak of has been the backbone of progress and innovation in this country. Please stop with your FemiNazi rhetoric.
Most women opinion on football related matters are irrelevant https://t.co/cOhvUI0mlr
Bitches think its attractive to be alot to handle grow the fuck up
those people who compare and drag women in the music industry all day, but say ‘fuck men’ a few times before they go to bed and think they are the peak of feminism .... :/
If you really want to understand the underlying motivation that drives the Brunch Democrats you have to understand that Hillary Clinton-era feminists believe sincerely that because white women are 2nd-class citizens to white men that they share the suffering of 3rd, 4th, 5th...

“ Hey, you said play anything so I did ! Even if it's dumb. ”The blonde hero quickly stick his tongue out playfully, showing how deep down he will always behave like a child. Of course luckily not many people seem to mind that about him ! https://t.co/MQ8IusrCbU
@BimwoA Sometimes it's hard not to tip toe into misandry when you really consider all the crimes and harms done against women....
@Ilovelampstill1 Lol her chief of staff at the time as well as AOC herself both gushed about how important The Intercept's coverage was to her campaign, but sure, call me sexist. And Glenn personally had no part in the Reality Winner fiasco

BREAKING: The Left is upset Rep. #TulsiGabbard has introduced a bill to bar #schools from receiving federal funds if they allow biological males to compete against biological females in #sports. Apparently fair competition in girl's sports is "anti-Trans". #WomensRights

As a Saudi women I couldn’t disagree more we as women could never dare to walk alone at night without the fear for our lives &amp; it’s not better in day either  #السعودية_الأكثر_أمانا

#ISRAEL: 79% of sexual harassment victims are women, the vast majority of whom are between the ages of 20 – 35 and who refrain from filing police complaints https://t.co/NaG0OwBJcL #VAW
@mawunyo_jeffery @xista_araba @Brown_SarkCess You nor nor what women go fit do err? Herr you don't know!!
@thehill Men shouldn’t compete in women’s sports is not “anti transgender”. That’s just common sense
The brainwashing is real, most men took the koolaid just for a chance to sniff their hair, fvcking sad#mgtowhttps://t.co/FXUGfGXJJu
I’m biting my  so mf hard this bitch might fall off
I want patriarchy and all it’s advocates to know that feminism is rage unleashed against their centuries of crimes against women! You can not exploit, oppress, rape, kill women and expect us to be calm about it. Feminists not just in Nigeria but world wide are rightfully angry https://t.co/sXmNRqCuZN
@ed_washingtonii you’re doing too much. I would hate to be your coworker or friend . your ass put chicken wings and then felt like it was racist because she got you chicken wings ? your social compass is off and you probably have some type of mental illness . or you’re just an attention whore
@_chebutter_  So your pillows are just for aesthetics? LolI know women love to have a lot of pillows on their bed, but use only a couple to sleep. I find it hard to sleep without a pillow. I know my neck will hurt the next day.
Fucking skank https://t.co/jcj65kXNHV
Tanaka .how the fuck would ya lose anyone .Sonia literally said that she loves us both equally . ONLY that .you really thought that a guy like me could take her away from you ?!I ' m tired of your excuses .don ' t talk to me unless you have a way to turn me back . https://t.co/Q4GPLkCqfG
@MotunOgunleye Is the woman a child? Was she dragged there with a rope? I totally hate how women like these play the "helpless victim card" This woman is a medical doctor for God's sake! How can she let a man treat her like this for years and still go back to this...
@itsumosad @tokyeeo You're insulting a real life demographic of women over a cartoon character you don't like and you're telling a minor asian woman right now to "learn her place" lmfao yeah your mom sounds like she instilled some great values alright
Again, the dichotomy between equality of opportunity and equally of outcome doesn't exist. These two terms aren't mutually exclusive. If you assume all people on average are equal, then equality of opportunity must imply equality of outcome, with minor variations. https://t.co/QTCiUf4Byy
@SpryGuy @SeriousSam26 @SilentAmuse @GPSolomon @bobosonow It took all but 3 tweets for you to call me racist and sexist. Wow. You fail to see real issues and blame everything on racism and sexism and identity shit. It’s a tiring gimmick. This. Is. Why. You. Lose.
@DADBODRESPECTER The first one that springs to mind is someone I knew in high school, and she doesn't not fit the "eeeeevil cock carousel riding harpy!" stereotype even outwardly; she was a bit frumpy and a social outcast. I mostly feel bad for her.
@BritMartinez @PardesSeleh WOMEN’s Mag gonna WOMEN’s Mag. Hey Toots — don’t want to be lonely? Literally walk into a coffee shop.Men have to earn Companionship.Women? It is given to them.Just like everything else they have.Me?Born alone.Work alone.Live alone.Die alone. With a smile. https://t.co/OWw6PCoSno
the only problem with that is, you have to go to the most logical person in said situation because any guy who justifies sexual harassment is demented anyway- it’s just easier to choose peace and turn your dms off but I understand now wanting to do that because of someone else
@Loveschild_ @ChiefPharmacst Lol why the sudden presumption that they are Feminists  ?
Thinking about that time 10 years ago when my profile picture was a black and white pic of me with a fake mustache and a middle-aged lady flirted with me and complimented my "thick mustache".I was like, "Um... it's from a vending machine. I'm 18."
@KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. Rich trophy wife fighting for her money friends.
@Rocabella4 @ItsJustJordan_1 &amp; now women are looking for men. While holding the jobs that men used to hold. &amp; it’s legislated for women to hold a certain % of these jobs. You have to read this book. It has all the answers. Trust me. https://t.co/uOTa4mpvfJ
You choose to be sexist and misogynistic and to not unlearn toxic masculinity for what? Coz you benefit from the patriarchy and you don’t wanna call out your friends on their BS? Or change coz it is uncomfortable? For what? Miss me with that mindset stay away from me  https://t.co/LFjCKVMMXF

Miley Cyrus Is More Daring Than Ever in a Graphic Tee, Sheer Tights  https://t.co/lNvtREwHMb via @Yahoo nothing was more daring than her naked skank ass aka wrecking ball! she's just the same ole ho!
@plumbellayt I get hit with that "its easier for women" thing from legit all the gaming men around me and its so fucking toxic. I try to correct them and say, "no man, its really not and if you're struggling to succeed, don't blame it on the women you see being successful"
The fact that Nigerian men constantly think that feminism revolves around them and them alone will never cease to amaze me. If fighting for YOUR RIGHTS is being ‘angry and bitter’ then yes, Nigerian feminism has every right to be. https://t.co/oMd5EPJKk9
Message to journalists &amp; editors: Transing children is wrong, calling blokes lesbians is wrong, allowing men to compete in female sports is wrong, making rape victims be examined by men who claim to be women is wrong. I won’t compromise on this even if you do. Truth will out.
@SenRickScott @JoeBiden I am sure ALL THE REPUBLICAN FEMALE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE PROUD THAT YOU SUPPORT A MAN WHO OPENLY BELIEVES IT IS OK TO GRAB A WOMAN ANYWHERE ON THEIR BODY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FAMOUS OR RICH &amp; INTENTIONALLY SEPARATE INNOCENT CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS

@NFD65 So them my life is just my family every time I have a relationship with anybody dan Dalesanndro makes sure to tell my family secrets which they are confused by the republicans women they hate me because I don’t like  war
Yeah keep scribbling skank https://t.co/efoA4wKw92
(3/3) No more mansplaining. No more being swindled out of money. Every woman (and person) should be able to feel they have autonomy and ownership of their car, no matter it’s make, model, or worth.
@DarrenJBeattie The odds are very good that trump has raped and/or sexually assaulted minors (perhaps on Epstein Island, perhaps elsewhere...) -not to mention many adult women- and paid a pornstar to spank him with a magazine while his wife was home w/ their newborn baby.
@ShannyForChrist No one put personal info out there that KATEY herself didn't share first!! And let's talk integrity... WTF does it say about someone who defends a woman who's a habitual DRUNK DRIVER? That BRAGGED about DRIVING home so drunk she passed out in the YARD! Yeah keep defending that! https://t.co/bi4chwmTwG
@im_moderate_ @Talhawaqas98 Yikes. I’m so happy I’m not muslim. A women saying she got domestically abused and felt her lowest, and a bunch of bearded extremists call her a feminazi? I hope more women will understand that it’s not culture it’s the religion itself.
